# Hub Binary Scanner for .Net

## Overview ##
The Hub .Net Binary Scanner allows you to scan .Net executables and libraries in their production environments for known vulnerabilities. It does not require access to source code, project files, or other metadata. A full installation of Black Duck Hub is required to obtain the vulnerability report.
